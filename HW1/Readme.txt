HW1 by Kevin Wu for CMPM163

Important notes:
Part A includes three rotating 3d objects, each one has its own shaders.
It also has three moving colored lights as well.

Part B blurs a grayscale image using Guassian 3x3 kernel. Sliding the
mouse left and wise adjusts the blur strength.

Part C uses the alternative option of placing the game of life on an object.
In my case I project the game of life scene as a texture on each side of a
3d cube.
