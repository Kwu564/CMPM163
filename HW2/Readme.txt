HW2 by Kevin Wu for CMPM163

Important notes:
Both parts can be navigated via mouse controls(orbit).

Part A includes a plane displaced representing terrain and
water displaced by its own height map. The water's shaders mixes
an ocean texture with an environment map. The water's reflectivity
can be controlled via the gui. Additionally, the terrain displacement
and water strength can be controlled via gui.

Part B uses a fire sprite I found online for the particle system. Various
controls for this system can be found in the gui such as the particle size, lifetime
and turbulence. The jaguar uses a Perlin noise function which modifies its vertices to make it 
look as if its breaking apart. I have also added an environment map into the same shader and
mixed it with colors being effected by the noise function to give the jaguar an almost
ethereal appearence.
