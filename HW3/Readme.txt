HW3 by Kevin Wu for CMPM163

Important notes:
Both parts can be navigated via mouse controls(orbit).

Part A includes a single wall of text that can be adjusted via the data.gui console. You
can also orbit around the scene.

Part B includes two SDF 3D meshes; one created through CSG union operation and another that
morphs from cube to a sphere in 10 seconds.

Part C is a pdf file.
